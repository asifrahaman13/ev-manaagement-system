# EV Management system

Fist clone the repository from the github using the following command:\

```
git init
git clone https://github.com/asifrahaman13/ev-manaagement-system.git
```
There are both backend as well as front-end for the website. Hence both the applications needs to be run.

## Backend 
```
cd backend/
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Front end

Now open another terminal 
```
cd frontend/
yarn install 
yarn start
```
